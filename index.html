                    <p>Hello, my name is Alex Bertuzzi. I have just started my coding journey and so far I think its going pretty well. I made this website with bootstrap utilizing html, css, and a little bit of javscript. Please take a look around and let me know what you think by using the form on the contact page.</p>
                        
                    <p>Do you want to know something really weird?</p>

                    <p>In the animated television series Futerama, Fry, is cryogenically frozen and wakes up in the year 3000. If you have seen the show you know theres a whole lot going on in the future. One thing you certainly didn't miss are the perfectly preserved human heads living in jars who were also cryogenically frozen, reanimated, and now live as heads in jars at a museum. As it turns out this museum and the technology to cryogenically preserve heads far into the future exists today in Comfort, Texas. Don't believe me? You can check out their website right <a href="http://www.timeship.org/stasis_foundation.html">here</a>. Maybe even go for a drive by the facility, its super creepy.</p>
