# 02-Bootcamp-Homework
This is the repository where the 02 Bootcamp Homework will be uploaded.

In this assignment I used bootstrap with html and css to create a website with three pages:
    index.html "About Me"
    contact.html "Contact"
    portfolio.html "Portfolio"

All three pages utilize the bootstrap frame work of collums and rows with bootstrap css and javascrip links.

There is a style.css page that I used to define the basic styling and placement of content uniformaly across the three pages.

The website is resposive with multiple breakpoints.

All three pages have a consistent header with working nav bar and a consistent "sticky" footer with social media links. 

The contact page includes a working form that sends an email to my personal email address utilizing "formspree.io."

The portfolio page is formatted to give links to my homework assignments on github. The first portfolio has an image that links to my first homework assignment on github, more to come.
